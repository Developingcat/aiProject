		<h2>What do studies show about the future of ai?</h2>
		
		<p>Studies show that AI is going to leave an impact almost every job possible. Education is going to be impacted, thus rendering the AI a more transformative example. Healthcare may result with AI being used as a standard tool for those with diagnostic work, other things such as law, transportation, languages-- many things can, will and are being impacted by AI.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Personal opinions?</h2>
		
		<p> I personally believe that ai could be handy if used properly-- I mean, if you think about it, it has to go off a preset, right? If you teach basic human things (such as being a kind and morally decent person) and use it for it's intended purpose, hypothetically; it should do it's job and not be out for everyones demise! It's just a matter of using it properly and knowing what you're doing, in my personl opinion.</p>
